# WORK EXPERIENCE
Data Scientist - Internship Nov 2018 - Jun 2019 BlueBit Technologies Surat, India
• Developed and Deployed a 97% accurate ML model with other team members for predicting the sales of yatra flight tickets based on seasonal data via AWS components.
• Participated in data preprocessing techniques like data cleaning, data transformation and data reduction to create a 90% productive model through machine learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, RF and XGBoost with hyperparameter-tuning.
• Enhanced data collection procedures by 20% through building predictive models in google analytic systems.
• Allocated a task to combine CNN and RNN models through ensemble learning once a week basis.

Data Analyst - Internship Oct 2017 - Mar 2018
QWESYS Digital Solutions Surat, India
• Provided support in writing python scripts that cleaned and appended (ETL) new files from numerous sources daily that reduced over 14 hours weekly for the operations team.
• Assisted in identifying working capital improvement of $100K through supplier payment terms by updating obsolete SQL queries.
• Presented visualization models to the stakeholder in Power BI dashboards for faster decision-making.

# PROJECTS
• Deep Convolution Neural Network for Tabular Data-processing: Ranked 1st in the batch for presenting and developing an automated method to convert non-image data (2D) into images (3D) via feature extraction method. Moreover, it beats all previous attempts to gain the highest performance on DCNN Architecture for several large and small tabular datasets.
• Object Centric Image Recognition: Implemented pretrained Keras models (InceptionV3, DenseNet121, ResNet50) which integrates methods like data augmentation, autoencoder and transfer learning to boost performance. Then, classify the images using CUDA-based ML algorithm (ELM) for parallel-processing and achieved a decent (>90%) accuracy on cifar10, cifar100, caltech101 and caltech256 datasets.
• Abstractive Text-Summarization: Designed a python program that generates 2-3 lines of a most relevant summary of the customer reviews on the amazon food products using time-series prediction (LSTM) encoder-decoder model within 5 to 10 seconds. Also, Various NLP techniques had been used in data cleaning and preparation phase.
• Attendance Taker-System via Face-Recognition [link]: Built an application that reduced processing time to 100 milliseconds for scanning faces in real-time and made the attendance filling process effortless for the professors at college.
