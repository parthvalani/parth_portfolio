# WORK EXPERIENCE


## Data Scientist - Internship | BlueBit Technologies


• Developed and Deployed a 97% accurate ML model with other team members for predicting the sales of yatra flight tickets based on seasonal data via AWS components.

• Participated in data preprocessing techniques like data cleaning, data transformation and data reduction to create a 90% productive model through machine learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, RF and XGBoost with hyperparameter-tuning.

• Enhanced data collection procedures by 20% through building predictive models in google analytic systems.

• Allocated a task to combine CNN and RNN models through ensemble learning once a week basis.

## Data Analyst - Internship | QWESYS Digital Solutions

• Provided support in writing python scripts that cleaned and appended (ETL) new files from numerous sources daily that reduced over 14 hours weekly for the operations team.

• Assisted in identifying working capital improvement of $100K through supplier payment terms by updating obsolete SQL queries.

• Presented visualization models to the stakeholder in Power BI dashboards for faster decision-making.

# PROJECTS

## [Project 1: Deep Convolution Neural Network for Tabular Data-processing](https://github.com/parthvalani/DCNN-for-Tabular-data)
•	Ranked 1st in the batch for presenting and developing an automated method to convert non-image data (2D) into images (3D) via feature extraction method. Moreover, it beats all previous attempts to gain the highest performance on DCNN Architecture for several large and small tabular datasets.

## [Project 2: Object Centric Image Recognition](https://github.com/parthvalani/Extreme-Learning-Machine)
•	Structured deep learning model in TensorFlow Framework which can achieved an average of 90% accuracy on big datasets. 

•	Implemented a model which integrates methods like data augmentation, feature extraction, feature fusion and transfer learning to boost the performance.

•	Converted classification algorithm from python to C code for GPU utilization using Nvidia CUDA Toolkit.

## [Project 3: Abstractive Text-Summarization](https://github.com/parthvalani/Text-summarization)
•	Designed a python program that generates 2-3 lines of a most relevant summary of the customer reviews on the amazon food products using time-series prediction (LSTM) encoder-decoder model within 5 to 10 seconds. Also, Various NLP techniques had been used in data cleaning and preparation phase.

## [Project 4: Attendance Taker-System via Face-Recognition](https://github.com/parthvalani/Attendence-Checker-System)
•	Built an application that reduced processing time to 100 milliseconds for scanning faces in real-time and made the attendance filling process effortless for the professors at our college.

## [Project 5: Sentimental Analysis using Twitter Data](https://github.com/parthvalani/Tweet-review-analysis)
•	Coded python program to get the sentiments of any word from the Twitter.

•	Utilized Twitter API to fetch the real time data and classify into positive, negative, and neutral tweets based on polarity. It detects the sarcastic tweets using emotions.
